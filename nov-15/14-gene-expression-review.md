# One page review

### Short summary
The paper provides a comprehensive (600+ references) survey of the
microbiological literature with a focus on research in the field of gene
expression and optimization in *Escherichia Coli*.

Must read **introduction** and **conclusions**.

### Detailed summary

The paper begins gently by introducing the importance of expressing recombinant
genes and producing protein products in various host organisms. The
introduction proceeds with the well-studied example of *E.coli* bacterium by
introducing the crucial elements of a gene and how each one affects the rate of
transcription.

The paper then divides into couple of sections, namely:

* Transcriptional regulation
* Translational regulation
* Protein targeting
* Molecular chaperones
* Codon usage
* Protein degradation
* Fermentation conditions

Each of these headings further explores findings that have been known to
influence gene expression and protein synthesis within a bacterium. Rich
information regarding the selection of promoter sequence, the design of coding region
and choice of other elements may be obtained from this review, for a desired
nature and level of expression. The author also discusses the industrial
potential of suggested solutions.

### Opinion
Must read. I was familiar with the most of the content but reading it provided
a necessary brush up and enrichment of my knowledge.
