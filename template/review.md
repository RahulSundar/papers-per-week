# One page review

### Short summary
Write a two to three line summary of the paper. Try to focus on the main idea
and understand the question authors are trying to answer.

### Detailed summary
A more extensive outline of the main points of the paper, including for example
assumptions made, arguments presented, data analyzed, and conclusions drawn.

The idea is to create some organized information about the paper that will help
you sort out the details

### List of questions
Create a list of questions that have come to your mind while reading the paper.
Whether you see any limitations in the methods or perhaps a better procedure
could have been followed or something which you just couldn't understand -
write everything

### Related work
Comment about any related work that you are familiar with. Mention any
differences that you can observe.

### Personal opinion
Your views about the paper. Address questions like whether authors did good in explaining what they
wanted to, or what is the potential impact of this study.

# Notes
* Ensure that you read any paper at least 3 times.
    1. First read the abstract, the introduction and the conclusion and look
through the references. If the paper is well written, you should now know what
problem the authors are addressing, why the problem is important, what the
authors solution is, what their solution contributes to the area, and how the
authors demonstrate/prove that their solutions works and that it improves on
other solutions in some way(s).
    2. Next read through the entire paper starting with the abstract again. Don't
skip over figures, re-read parts that you don't understand. Write down
questions you have as you go along.
    3. Finally, re-read the paper *critically*. Did the authors do what they said
they were going to do? What are the important ideas? (just because an author
says something is important doesn't mean it really is) Do their results make
sense? Are their methods sound? What assumptions are they making? How does
their work fit in with other similar work? What improvements/extensions do they
contribute?
* This is not an easy task. It may require going over the paper several times.
  Expect to spend **several hours** to read a paper.
* Make notes as you read the paper.
