# One page review

### Short summary
A fairly old paper (published in 1989) that describes initial attempts by
researchers to carry out *de novo* protein synthesis (focusing especially on
structure design). Most attempts had positive results, and people were
able to successfully synthesize stable alpha helices, beta structures, helix
bundles, fibrous and membrane proteins. It also discusses the relative
difficulty of several approaches (peptide synthesis, *in vivo* synthesis) and
strongly predicts better success in near future.

### Detailed summary
The paper briefly discusses the some of the key advancements made in the area
of *de novo* protein synthesis. Although, there have been many attempts to
modify existing natural proteins to have better catalytic activity or even
completely different activity; all of them may be categorized under the domain
of activity design. The theme introduced in this paper deals with the domain of
structure design. The reason we want to tinker with protein sequences and build
our own designs is that it may offer better and often critical insights into
the protein structure, which otherwise is not possible by studying natural
proteins.

The review begins with the attempts to synthesize alpha helices, one of the
simplest secondary protein structures. Several scientists worked with the
synthetic analogs and established that they indeed form helical structures like
the native ones, who are not helical in solution but do form helix at the
surface of membranes. Another group then further observed the distribution of
negatively charged residues near the beginning of helix and positively charged
towards the end. This created a dipole which then greatly influenced the
stability of helix. Salt links and side chain interactions were also found
significant.

In the next sections, there is an interesting case study about design and synthesis
of a Beta sheet protein called *betabellin*. There are a couple of interesting
observations in this study:

* The initial attempts to synthesize *betabellin* gave a water insoluble form.
  This is because peptides that form Beta sheet are usually hydrophobic.
* Introduction of cystein residue helped stabilize the structure by forming a
  disulfide bond.
* The *betabellin* structure prepared at the end of the study was water soluble
  (in somewhat acidic pH), but not crystallizable. Hence, while authors could
  ensure that there indeed is a disulfide bond formed inside the monomer structure,
  there is no precise data to verify if the final structure is exactly what they
  designed.

Success with *betabellin* inspired authors to attempt a similar *protein-like*
design of helix bundle. Taking into account the usual factors for design of
alpha helices, a remarkable success was achieved in form of *Felix*. The CD
spectrum showed high alpha helix content, and excellent solubility. Michael
Hecht was even successful in expressing the protein in *E.coli* system.

Another interesting strategy devised by a couple of scientists does away with
the problem of protein folding by designing *TASP* molecules.

> structures by branching covalent connectivities, rather than using biological
> style, self assembly from linear chain.

What this means is that instead of letting the linear peptide chain fold in
self-assembled manner, we design a short central peptide template with residues
that act as attachment sites. These residues are placed according the desired
tertiary structure of our assembly. Subsequently, we link the individual
protein units to these attachment sites which can then assemble together to
form tertiary structures, for e.g., four helix bundle.

Towards the end, authors make several observations based on these experiments:

* Membrane proteins might be simpler to design than the soluble proteins
* Alpha helices are easier to design than the Beta sheets (e.g., *Felix* vs *Betabellin*)
* Peptide synthesis is better for producing material quickly and reliably while synthesis
  *in vivo* is much easier once a successful expression system is found and is essential
  for long sequences.
* Reverse design method i.e., to start from a design and then synthesize sequences is
  more successful than the prediction of structure from sequence.

### Personal opinion
We have come a long way in protein structure design and synthesis, but this
paper is still significant as it introduces us to some of the early challenges
faced by the researchers. With little understanding of forces responsible for
stable protein structure and interaction, they made astoundingly great
progress; just with the help of repeated experiments and critical observations.

A recommended read.
